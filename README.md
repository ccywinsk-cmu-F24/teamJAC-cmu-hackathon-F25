### The Problem üòü

Financial illiteracy costs Americans an estimated **$415 billion** each year. A staggering **73% of people** live paycheck to paycheck, often trapped in cycles of debt and financial stress.

Traditional financial education is often inaccessible, intimidating, or designed for those who are already wealthy. This leaves behind huge segments of our communities, including first-generation college students, gig workers, immigrants, and the formerly incarcerated. Information is not enough; people need to practice making decisions in a safe environment.

### Our Solution: Learn by Doing ‚ú®

InvestEd closes this gap by providing an **empathy-driven, actionable, and accessible** platform. We break down complex financial topics into 5-minute daily lessons and simulations. Instead of just reading about money, our users practice making real-world financial decisions and see the immediate impact of their choices.
